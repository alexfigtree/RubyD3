    # Implements a grid layout with regularly-sized rows and columns. The
    # number of rows and columns are determined from their respective
    # properties. For example, the 2&times;3 array:
    #
    # <pre>1 2 3
    # 4 5 6</pre>
    #
    # can be represented using the <tt>rows</tt> property as:
    #
    # <pre>[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]</pre>
    #
    # If your data is in column-major order, you can equivalently use the
    # <tt>columns</tt> property. If the <tt>rows</tt> property is an array, it
    # takes priority over the <tt>columns</tt> property. The data is implicitly
    # transposed, as if the {@link pv.transpose} operator were applied.
    #
    # <p>This layout exports a single <tt>cell</tt> mark prototype, which is
    # intended to be used with a bar, panel, layout, or subclass thereof. The data
    # property of the cell prototype is defined as the elements in the array. For
    # example, if the array is a two-dimensional array of values in the range
    # [0,1], a simple heatmap can be generated as:
    #
    # <pre>vis.add(pv.Layout.Grid)
    #     .rows(arrays)
    #   .cell.add(pv.Bar)
    #     .fillStyle(pv.ramp("white", "black"))</pre>
    #
    # The grid subdivides the full width and height of the parent panel into equal
    # rectangles. Note, however, that for large, interactive, or animated heatmaps,
    # you may see significantly better performance through dynamic {@link pv.Image}
    # generation.
    #
    # <p>For irregular grids using value-based spatial partitioning, see {@link
    # pv.Layout.Treemap}.
